#### Inspired by Brad Schiff's [Wordpress course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/).

Pick a project from the list below, and complete it, ensuring you fulfil the user stories.


## General aims of these projects:

### WordPress SITES development:

- Introduce yourself to the process of developing a WordPress site - this can be from scratch, a starter theme such as https://underscores.me/ or by modifying an existing theme (either yours or a free theme).

- Come up with a workflow that you can apply to subsequent WordPress site development.

- Come up with modular components that you can reuse in future projects.

- Be mobile-friendly. If comfortable, aim for mobile-first development. Make sure the your WordPress site passes Google's Mobile-Friendly test. https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly

### WordPress THEME development:

- Modify one of your WordPress projects into a reusable theme (for example, if you made followed the Portfolio Project, strip it of specific data and make it into a theme anyone could use).

- Make the theme customisable by the user e.g. they can pick their own color scheme; they can decide on the location of images, etc.

- Submit a theme to WordPress.org and get it passed https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/submitting-your-theme-to-wordpress-org/


### NOTES:
If you have an idea for a project challenge that could be added to this pack, fork this repo, add it to the relevant document (band1-extra, band2-extra, band3-extra), then put in a pull request. Make sure each has a title, a brief description, and a set of user stories. It's an easy way to get into contributing on Github without the dread of screwing up someone's code.

We need our site to:

**Front Page**

- allow customers to create accounts and log in
	
- have staff accounts


**Games**

- have a list of games available to play

- have a page for each game that includes its description, reviews and an affiliate link to purchase it on amazon

- allow logged-in users can leave a review of each game


**Events**	

- have an upcoming events page

- have a description page for each individual event

- let staff accounts add/edit events
	
**Group bookings**
	
- let logged-in users book one of our five tables for sessions from 1 to 3 hours in length

- let users select up to three games they would like to play during their session

- not allow tables or games to be double booked

**Advanced**

- Allow there to be multiple copies of each game. The system tracks how many copies of each game are available at any time
